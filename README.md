### ***User Experience***

> #### User Story #1
> ##### Tony is extremely competitive and is looking for a game where he can take on his friends without spending a lot of time explaining how to play.
> #### User Story #2
> ##### Lisa and her sister are trying to resolve a dispute in a fair and just manner.  They need an unbiased medium in which to compete to determine who wins.
> #### As a user...
> * ##### I should be able to click an area of the board and my letter appear.
> * ##### I should expect the turn to switch to the opposing player after I have gone.
> * ##### I should see an alert appear when I have acheived 3 in a row.
> * ##### I should have the option to play again after the completion of the game.
> * ##### It should be clear to me when no one has won the game.
